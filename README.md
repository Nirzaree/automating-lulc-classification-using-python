# automating-lulc-classification-using-python
Compute Land Use Land Cover (LULC) for any area of your choice, using the model trained
in the [lulc_classification_using_deep_learning](https://github.com/Nirzaree/lulc_classification_using_deep_learning)
repo. 

This repo is built on the part 2 of the [lulc tutorial](https://github.com/climatechange-ai-tutorials/lulc-classification/blob/main/land_use_land_cover_part2.ipynb) in CCAI Summer school 

I computed LULC of 2024 of Bangalore, India where I live:

I plan to compute change of LULC for a few Indian cities, to quantify the reduction in green cover 
in the cities, in the last few years.
